# Either use absolute path to save the graph file like /path/to/save/ or
# use a relative path to a package. For example, package_name/graphs/.
# In case of graph file save being relative to a package, use of '/' is not required.
# The graph name is used to create the filename, for example, graph_file_name.graphml.
# Finally, the graph will be save at save_graph_url/graph_file_name.graphml.
