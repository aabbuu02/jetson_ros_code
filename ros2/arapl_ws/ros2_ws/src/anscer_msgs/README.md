ü§ñ anscer_msgs
Custom message, service, and action definitions for the Anscer Robotics platform migrated from ROS 1 to ROS 2.

üöÄ Overview
This package provides the custom data types required for communication between nodes in the Anscer Robotics system. By centralizing these definitions, it ensures type safety and consistency across all client and server applications.

Key Conversion Changes (ROS 1 to ROS 2)
Build System: Migrated from Catkin to ament_cmake (using colcon).

Interface Generation: ROS 1 macros (add_message_files, generate_messages) were replaced by the single rosidl_generate_interfaces command in CMakeLists.txt.

Message Referencing: All custom messages are now referenced using the package name prefix (e.g., anscer_msgs/ACRControl).

Standard Types: ROS 1 types like Header and Pose are now prefixed with their standard packages (e.g., std_msgs/Header, geometry_msgs/Pose).

üì¶ Package Structure
The package follows the standard ROS 2 interface structure:

Directory	Content Type	Purpose
msg/	Messages (.msg)	Simple data structures and arrays (e.g., BatteryInfo.msg, Task.msg).
srv/	Services (.srv)	Synchronous request-response pairs (e.g., MapReload.srv, SavePose.srv).
action/	Actions (.action)	Long-running goals with feedback and results (e.g., Mission.action, Dock.action).
CMakeLists.txt	Build Configuration	Uses ament_cmake and rosidl_default_generators to build interfaces.
package.xml	Package Manifest	Declares build/run dependencies and identifies the package as an rosidl_interface_packages member.
üõ†Ô∏è Building the Package
This package must be built using the ROS 2 build tool, colcon.

Place the package in the src folder of your ROS 2 workspace.

Build the package from the workspace root:

colcon build --packages-select anscer_msgs

Source the workspace install directory to make the new interfaces available:


source install/setup.bash
